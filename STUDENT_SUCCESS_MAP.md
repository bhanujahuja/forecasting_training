## Learning Efficiency Tips

### Do This ✅
```
✓ Read markdown first (understand theory)
✓ Code along (type it yourself)
✓ Experiment (change parameters)
✓ Test your understanding (quiz yourself)
✓ Document findings
✓ Compare methods on YOUR data
✓ Take breaks (hour on, 10 min off)
✓ Teach someone else (test your knowledge)
```

### Don't Do This ❌
```
✗ Copy-paste code without reading
✗ Skip the markdown, just run notebooks
✗ Rush through mini-projects
✗ Study for 4+ hours straight
✗ Only learn methods, skip understanding why
✗ Use only one dataset
✗ Skip review questions
✗ Ignore error messages
```

## Success Formula

```
Success = 
    (Quality Reading: 30%) +
    (Consistent Practice: 40%) +
    (Regular Review: 20%) +
    (Hands-on Projects: 10%)

Where:
- Quality Reading = Understanding, not skimming
- Consistent Practice = Code along every module
- Regular Review = Answer review questions, use glossary
- Projects = Mini-projects + Capstone
```
