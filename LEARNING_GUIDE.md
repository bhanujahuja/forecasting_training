## 📊 Each Module: 3-Step Learning Process

### Step 1: Understand (Theory Reading)
1. **Read markdown file completely** (start to finish)
2. **Take notes** on key concepts (summarize in your words)
3. **Identify questions** - mark confusing sections
4. **Look up answers** in official docs or Google
5. **Create mental model** - how does this fit with prior knowledge?

### Step 2: Practice (Hands-On)
1. **Read notebook cell by cell** (don't just run it all)
2. **Understand the code** before executing
3. **Run each cell individually** - check output
4. **Modify the code** - change parameters, see what happens
5. **Experiment** - try your own variations
6. **Break it intentionally** - understand error messages

### Step 3: Apply (Mini-Project)
1. **Read project description** completely
2. **Plan before coding** - outline steps
3. **Implement step by step** - don't rush
4. **Test thoroughly** - is output correct?
5. **Document findings** - write observations
6. **Review your work** - could it be clearer?

## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Learning

### Tip 1: Code from Scratch
**Don't:** Copy-paste code from notebook
**Do:** Type it yourself, understand each line

This reinforces memory and reveals what you don't understand.

### Tip 2: Create Cheat Sheets
After each module, create a one-page summary:
- Key concepts
- When to use this method
- Main formula/parameters
- Common pitfalls
- Example code snippet

### Tip 3: Teach Someone Else
Explain concepts to a friend, family member, or even rubber duck programming.

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

### Tip 4: Compare All Methods on Your Data
The magic of this course is seeing which methods work best for YOUR problem.

Don't just memorize - compare on your data!

### Tip 5: Keep a Learning Journal
After each session, write 5 minutes on:
- What you learned
- What confused you
- What you'll do differently next time
- Connections to prior knowledge

### Tip 6: Join a Study Group
- Discuss confusing concepts
- Share your projects
- Motivate each other
- Learn from others' approaches

### Tip 7: Build Incrementally
Don't try to implement everything at once.
- Week 1: Get data, do EDA
- Week 2: Try baselines
- Week 3: Add ARIMA
- Week 4: Add ML
- Week 5: Add DL
- Week 6: Optimize

### Tip 8: Read Error Messages Carefully
They usually tell you exactly what's wrong:
- `KeyError: 'Passengers'` → Check column name
- `ValueError: x and y must be same length` → Check shapes
- `FileNotFoundError: 'data.csv'` → Check file path
