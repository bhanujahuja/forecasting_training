└─ No clear path forward
└─ Gives up or struggles
```

### Student Getting Stuck (After)
```
"I don't understand ARIMA"
└─ Check: COMPREHENSIVE_STUDY_GUIDE.md "ARIMA section"
   (Reads theory explanation + worked examples)
└─ Still unclear? Check: DEEP_DIVE_CONCEPTS.md
   (See visual explanations and formula breakdowns)
└─ Try again with notebook
└─ Use practice problems to test understanding
└─ Now confident with ARIMA
```

### Student Choosing Method (Before)
```
